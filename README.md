## What's this

This is a template for quickly creating a basic Android project.

Through this template, you can quickly create a clean and concise standard Android project.

The template automatically integrates [Flexi UI](https://github.com/BetterAndroid/FlexiUI) and [BetterAndroid](https://github.com/BetterAndroid/BetterAndroid) dependency for you,
which can help make your development easier.

If you need to use traditional development methods, please refer to another template [android-app-template](https://github.com/BetterAndroid/android-app-template).

## Get Started

Click the "Use this template" button on GitHub to use this template.

After successfully creating a new repository, use the `git clone` command to clone your project locally, do not open the project immediately at this time.

In the root directory of the project, you can find two files, `initializer.json` and `initializer.py`, please open the `initializer.json` file, the contents are as follows.

```json
{
   // Your project name, this will be used as the name of the entire Gradle project, only English is allowed
   "__PROJECT_NAME__": "android-compose-app-demo",
   // Your app name
   "__APP_NAME__": "Android Compose App Demo",
   // Your app package name
   "__PACKAGE_NAME__": "com.highcapable.androidcomposeappdemo"
}
```

After editing the configuration file, run the `initializer.py` script to initialize the project, after successful initialization, these two files will be automatically deleted.

If there is no Python in your system, please go to [official website](https://www.python.org/) to download one, and then execute `python3 initializer.py` on the command line.

If you are using macOS or Linux, you can execute `./initializer.py` directly.

After the project is initialized successfully, you can use Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA to open the project.
